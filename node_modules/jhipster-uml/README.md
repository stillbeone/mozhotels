Welcome to JHipster-UML!

This project's main goal is to bring support of UML (more precisely, XMI) files (from various editors) to JHipster so that it can read the files, without you answering the questions.

You'll be able to create your entities by supplying a UML file (made with your favorite editor, if it supports XMI) to JHipster, and we'll take care of creating your entities for you!

We support: Modelio, UML Designer, GenMyModel and Visual Paradigm... and our DSL!


For more information, visit our [Wiki page](https://jhipster.github.io/jhipster-uml/) in JHipster's wiki.

**Pretty important note**: v1.7.0 will **only** support JHipster v3.0+. The versions before v1.7.0 will still support anterior versions of JHipster.
**Thank you**.
